## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
- The script modifies the `hosts` file located at:
  ```
  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
  ```
- If you want to **undo** the changes, manually remove the following line from `hosts`:
  ```
  127.0.0.1 display.ad.daum.net
  ```
- You can check if the ads are blocked by running:
  ```sh
  ping display.ad.daum.net
  ```
  If it returns `127.0.0.1`, the block is successful.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
1. **Script does not work?**  
   - Make sure you are running it as **Administrator**.
   - Run `ipconfig /flushdns` manually in Command Prompt.
   
2. **Still seeing ads?**  
   - Check if KakaoTalk is using cached data.  
   - Try restarting your computer.
